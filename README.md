# SoftRd

Welcome to SoftRd, a Software 3D Rendering Engine based on C++.  


This is my individual project due to my interest in computer graphic and rendering pipeline implementation. I developed this project by native C++ from the scratch and refer to the Opengl rendering pipeline standard. Basically, it can read model files and render them into scenes by different mode and support basic lighting and different customizing shading effect. Now I'm still building the windows version on visual studio, extending new features, optimizing structure and performance. Ideally, it can also support cross platform running on other operating system.
